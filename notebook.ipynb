    "**Race, Dialect, and Gender**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dialects are considered variations of languages that are generally mutually understandable. Due to English  being spoken in multiple different countries among diverse groups of speakers, English speakers exhibit diverse accents, localized words, and grammatical structures based on their countries and regions. Major English dialects are often classified into British Isles, North American, and Australasian categories. Dialects are not only linked to geographical regions but also to specific social groups. Each English-speaking country has its version of Standard English, often associated with education and formal communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, I examined and analyized how Microsoft's Speech-to-text translation API performs on differnet dialects, specifically standard American English, standard British English, and African American Venacular English, to see if the API's algorithm performs better on any of these groups compared to the others. I also wanted to see if this, or differences in race or differences in gender would yield a more drastic performance gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the dataset, I collected the transcripts of SNL monologues from Youtube performed by different men and women, all of which were native English speakers. \n",
    "\n",
    "I had three different ways of analyzing performance as mentioned before. First and foremost, I analyized the performance between dialects of English with speakers being categorized into one of three groups containing the following people:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. African American Venacular English:\n",
    "   - Keke Palmer (Black)\n",
    "   - Tiffany Haddish (Black)\n",
    "   - Eddie Murphy (Black)\n",
    "   - Megan Thee Stallion (Black)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Standard American English\n",
    "   - Billie Eilish (white)\n",
    "   - Kim Kardashian (white)\n",
    "   - Don Cheadle (Black)\n",
    "   - Ayo Edebiri (Black)\n",
    "   - Jack Harlow (white)\n",
    "   - Pete Davidson (white)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Standard British English\n",
    "   - Daniel Kaluuya (Black)\n",
    "   - Idris Elba (Black)\n",
    "   - Benedict Cumberbatch (white)\n",
    "   - Phoebe Waller-Bridge (white)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The second analysis measured how race affects the accuracy of speech-to-text translation, with two categories in this case:\n",
    "1. Black:\n",
    "   - Daniel Kaluuya /\n",
    "   - Idris Elba /\n",
    "   - Don Cheatle /\n",
    "   - Keke Palmer /\n",
    "   - Tiffany Haddish /\n",
    "   - Eddie Murphy /\n",
    "   - Megan Thee Stallion /\n",
    "   - Ayo Edebiri /\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. White:\n",
    "   - Benedict Cumberbatch \n",
    "   - Jack Harlow\n",
    "   - Pete Davidson\n",
    "   - Phoebe Waller-Bridge \n",
    "   - Billie Eilish \n",
    "   - Kim Kardashian \n",
    "\n",
    "Third, I also wanted to see if gender would have a noticable impact on the performance of the speech-to-text algorithm, with categorizing the speakers into one of two categories:\n",
    "1. Women\n",
    "   - Keke Palmer \n",
    "   - Tiffany Haddish \n",
    "   - Megan Thee Stallion\n",
    "   - Ayo Edebiri\n",
    "   - Billie Eilish \n",
    "   - Kim Kardashian  \n",
    "   - Phoebe Waller-Bridge\n",
    "2. Men\n",
    "   - Benedict Cumberbatch\n",
    "   - Pete Davidson\n",
    "   - Jack Harlow\n",
    "   - Eddie Murphy \n",
    "   - Daniel Kaluuya \n",
    "   - Idris Elba\n",
    "\n",
    "My hypotheses was that 1. dialect 2. gender 3. race would be the order. \n"
