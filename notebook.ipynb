    "# Dialect, Race, Gender, and The Pressure to Confirm to Standards\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction and Motivations\n",
    "Dialects are considered variations of languages that are generally mutually understandable. Due to English  being spoken in multiple different countries among diverse groups of speakers, English speakers exhibit diverse accents, localized words, and grammatical structures based on their countries and regions. Major English dialects are often classified into British Isles, North American, and Australasian categories. Dialects are not only linked to geographical regions but also to specific social groups. Each English-speaking country has its version of Standard English, often associated with education and formal communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, I examined and analyized how Microsoft's Speech-to-text translation API performs on different dialects, specifically standard American English, standard British English, and African American Venacular English, to see if the API's algorithm performs better on any of these groups compared to the others. I also wanted to see if this, or differences in race or differences in gender would yield a more drastic performance gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset and Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "For the dataset, I collected the transcripts of SNL monologues from Youtube performed by different men and women, all of which were native English speakers. I downloaded the videos from Youtube from the website https://y2down.cc/en/youtube-wav.html. After getting the .wav files, I collected the transcripts from https://snltranscripts.jt.org/2022/megan-thee-stallion-monologue.phtml, then edited the transcript by listening to the files and making changes whereever needed. I also edited the .wav files, so it would only include the speaker's speech throughout the script, and edited out parts that had a lot of background noise (for example, clapping) to make ensure that the speech-to-text transcription algorithm is as fair between different speakers as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had three different ways of analyzing performance as mentioned before:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dialects\n",
    "First and foremost, I analyized the performance between dialects of English with speakers being categorized into one of three groups containing the following people:\n",
    "1. African American Venacular English:\n",
    "   - Keke Palmer (Black)\n",
    "   - Tiffany Haddish (Black)\n",
    "   - Eddie Murphy (Black)\n",
    "   - Megan Thee Stallion (Black)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Standard American English\n",
    "   - Billie Eilish (white)\n",
    "   - Kim Kardashian (white)\n",
    "   - Don Cheadle (Black)\n",
    "   - Ayo Edebiri (Black)\n",
    "   - Jack Harlow (white)\n",
    "   - Pete Davidson (white)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Standard British English\n",
    "   - Daniel Kaluuya (Black)\n",
    "   - Idris Elba (Black)\n",
    "   - Benedict Cumberbatch (white)\n",
    "   - Phoebe Waller-Bridge (white)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Race\n",
    "The second analysis measured how race affects the accuracy of speech-to-text translation, with two categories in this case:\n",
    "1. Black Speakers:\n",
    "   - Daniel Kaluuya \n",
    "   - Idris Elba \n",
    "   - Don Cheatle \n",
    "   - Keke Palmer \n",
    "   - Tiffany Haddish \n",
    "   - Eddie Murphy \n",
    "   - Megan Thee Stallion \n",
    "   - Ayo Edebiri \n",
    "  \n",
    "2. White Speakers:\n",
    "   - Benedict Cumberbatch \n",
    "   - Jack Harlow\n",
    "   - Pete Davidson\n",
    "   - Phoebe Waller-Bridge \n",
    "   - Billie Eilish \n",
    "   - Kim Kardashian \n",
    "\n",
    "### Gender\n",
    "I also wanted to see if gender would have a noticable impact on the performance of the speech-to-text algorithm, with categorizing the speakers into one of two categories:\n",
    "1. Women\n",
    "   - Keke Palmer \n",
    "   - Tiffany Haddish \n",
    "   - Megan Thee Stallion\n",
    "   - Ayo Edebiri\n",
    "   - Billie Eilish \n",
    "   - Kim Kardashian  \n",
    "   - Phoebe Waller-Bridge\n",
    "2. Men\n",
    "   - Benedict Cumberbatch\n",
    "   - Pete Davidson\n",
    "   - Jack Harlow\n",
    "   - Eddie Murphy \n",
    "   - Daniel Kaluuya \n",
    "   - Idris Elba\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypotheses and Setup \n",
    "My hypotheses was that dialect will have the biggest impact, second will be gender, then out of these three race will result in the smallest difference between groups. \n"

    "From these results, we can see that my original hypotheses was not entirely correct. I predicted that dialect will result in the largest disparity between the performance of the speech-to-text recognition, and this proved to be true. Standard British and American English performed significantly better than AAVE. Gender, however, had less of an impact on the performance of the algorithm, instead, race had a larger impact, with white speakers' speech being recognized 0.0214 better compared to Black speakers, while the algorithm performing only 0.0178 points better on mens' speeches compared to womens' speeches.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note, however, that these findings might not be generally true for all kinds of speeches, and in all contexts, since in this study only examined the algorithm's performance on 14 speakers. A thorough, generalizable audit should include significantly more speakers (probably in the 100s, or even 1000s), and should also include differnt contexts, not just pre-written, well-perfomed SNL monologues.
