Thank you. Thank you very much. My name is IVA Debris and I am so excited to be here. SNL means so much to me. This really is a dream come true.
I was born and raised in Boston, which makes me the first black woman to ever admit that.
Yeah, three days into February and I'm already making black history.
But no, I was raised in Boston by an immigrant family. We are both African and Caribbean, so you know what that means. I'm in therapy.
There were a lot of high expectations for all of us. A lot of my cousins are doctors and lawyers and professors, so while they were busy saving lives and teaching children, I was doing something equally noble.
Stand up comedy shows in the backs of laundromats.
But now I'm proud to say I'm the cousin who made the biggest turn around. And no matter what happens, I will always have the approval of all Nigerian aunts and uncles across the world on WhatsApp.
Some of you might know me from a show called The Bear.
It's about the kitchen staff at a Chicago restaurant, and it's such a fun show to work on. But when I got cast, I was told there was going to be a lot of research before shooting the first season. We all had to work in actual restaurants so we could truly capture that kitchen energy. When people saw my costar Jeremy Allen White working in the restaurant, they'd be like, whoa, that's Jeremy Allen White. You must be preparing for a role so Method. And when they saw me, they'd just be like, how much longer for my tilapia?
Before all of this, I was a stand up comic in New York City writing jokes and doing open mics.
First ever round of applause for open mics, but I I really always wanted to do this show and I just had so many ideas. I actually once wrote a packet but I didn't really have the nerve to submit it and I printed it out. Is that OK if I just, I don't know, shares and stuff?
Oh, my God, this is taking me back. Oh, OK. Yeah, this one I see right here. You guys know that sketch Black Jeopardy?
Yeah. So I wanted to do a sketch called White Jeopardy, which didn't work because it was just white people playing Jeopardy.
Oh, OK, yeah. And then this one just, I love a character with a catch phrase. You know, like, catch phrases work because anybody can say them and get a big reaction. And this one was a hop on to it now.
It's not bad. It's not the worst, You know what I mean? Anyone could say it. A cast member? A hose. Just like imagine Kina, you know being like Hop won't do it. Now you know.
The Queen of England.
Hop on to it? No.
Trademarking that tonight? OK, yeah, I think we're done with this.
Burn it.
Genuinely, I am so excited for tonight. I came up in the New York comedy scene with some of my best friends who I am so blessed to be working with here tonight, and it really, truly feels like a homecoming. And I think I've been up here long enough so there's really only one thing left to say.
Let's hop on to it now. We've got a great show for you tonight. Jennifer Lopez is here.
 Lopez, this year.
