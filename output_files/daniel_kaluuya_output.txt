Thank you. Thank you very much. I can't believe it's Saturday Night Live in New York City.
My name is Daniel Kaluya and first of all, I know you're hearing my accent and thinking, Oh no, he's not black.
He's British. Let me reassure you that I am black.
I'm black and I'm British.
Basically, and what the Royal Family was worried the baby would look like.
Yeah, people are asking. People ask me what's worse, British racism or American racism. Let me put it this way, British racism is so bad, white people left.
They wanted to be free, free to create their own kind of racism, so that's why they invented Australia, South Africa and Boston.
My family. My family. Wait, wait. My family's from Uganda. My family's from Uganda. Anyone from Uganda here? That's my auntie. She actually is here.
I come from a big Ugandan family. It's no joke. My mom is 1 of 22 kids and my dad is 1 of 49. Yeah, my family's sperm is literally about that life.
They say black don't crack, but condoms do.
I've just portrayed the leader of the Illinois chapter, the Black Panther Party, a man. A man who a man who created strategies for free education, free healthcare, and free breakfast for kids. His name is Chairman Fred Hampton.
Actually won a Golden Globe for that role. Yeah, but but wait, wait, whoa, whoa, wait. It was on Zoom. Yeah, and this is what happened.
Can you believe that? I told the best joke of my life and I was new in I felt like I was in a sunken place.
Now, before we get started, I just want to say how grateful I am to be. You know, when I was nine years old, I wrote a play that got performed at Hampton Theater with real actors and everything. And this is a true story. That play was based on Keenan and Kill. Yeah. And that play led me down a path that got me to this stage tonight with Keenan backstage right now. So I just want to take this moment in front, Akina and the whole world to say thank you, Mum.
Thank you, God.
And thank you, Kel.
We got great.

We got great.
