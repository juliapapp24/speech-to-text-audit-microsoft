Thank you. Thank you very much. It is so great to be here. I entered The Avengers Host SNL raffle and I won.
So this is my first time hosting and I think I waited this long because I'm a little OCD about my projects. You know, I was in the movie traffic, then I was in rush hour, then I was in crash, so that had to be in the right order.
I've been in show business for over 30 years, and a lot of people know me and a whole lot of people sort of know me. You know, I get what I call percussive recognition. They're like, oh, you're.
You know, the longer it goes on, it kind of turns into a Tito Puente thing. They're like.
You know when you when you played as many characters as I have, you have fans from all kind of different things. You know, it's gotten to the point where I know what people recognize me from based on the face they make when they walk up. You know, if I get a dude with a face like.
I know that's Boogie nights.
If I get this.
Yeah, that's Hotel Rwanda face.
And then if I get this.
Well, that's the face of a true fan who realizes he's about to meet Ice Tray from the Homeboy sweet homeboy episode of Fresh Prince of Bel Air.
You know, really, I love any fan who wants to meet me, especially the people from New York City.
I love New Yorkers because they are direct. You know, most places it's like, hey, can I take a picture? But in New York, it's like, yo, let's get this pic, dog.
And you know, we're not gonna stop at just one pick. I mean, we're gonna have three options. We're gonna get the goofy one. We gotta get the serious one. And then all of a sudden, I'm taking a picture of just them. I'm not even in the thing. No, but I'm. I'm always happy to take a picture. The key is you just gotta wait for the proper moment. Because they have in the middle of my monologue right now. I got you. I got you.
OK, we're good. We're good.
e good.
