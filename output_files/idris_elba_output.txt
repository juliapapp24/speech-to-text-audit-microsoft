Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Listen, I'm Mr. Shelba and it is great to be here hosting Saturday Night Live.
Before this, the closest thing I did to a comedy was The Wire.
And this is really amazing. I mean, you have no idea how honestly grateful I am to be here tonight. About 20 years ago, I was working down the street from this building on Broadway, not as an actor, but as a doorman. I was a bouncer at Carolines Comedy Club on 49th from Broadway. Thank you.
Now now, that was my night job when I started in this country, this, this, this, this time of year, I would be standing outside freezing my ******** off. I mean, I'm not joking. It was a decent job though. I made some great contacts, by which I mean I sold weed.
I'm not proud of it. It's just a fact. I I did get some auditions. I'd walk in for a role, say Brooklyn Gangster number one, and the casting director would look at me intrigued and I'd, I'd say my line, you know, we gotta run the Big Apple tonight, mate.
Yeah, I didn't get the part. My mom would call me from London and say Idris, you have to have a backup plan. I said Mom, listen, relax, I've got a backup plan. Don't worry, I'm a DJ.
She would cry.
So after a couple of years at that, man, I thought it was time to pack it in, get a real job like a full time drug dealer. Yeah.
But my sister, bless her heart, she had her actual job. She worked at Bad Boy Records. Now, you know, Puffy was my biggest inspiration. Biggie was my favorite rapper. But it was a bad time because Biggie had just died and my sister took me to this Biggie memorial and everyone was there. I mean everyone. It was like, it was like being at a wax museum where the wax figures were smoking blunts and drinking Alizee.
It was so surreal. I remember thinking if it's possible for me to be standing in that room right now than anything is possible. So I decided I wouldn't give up on my dream and and that was 22 years ago to this day and a few years after that I got an audition for a small pilot called The Wire. And now I am I am in the building where television started, in the city where hip hop started and I'm hosting Saturday Night Live.
So we gonna learn the Big Apple tonight, mate. We've got a great show for you. Khalid is here.
