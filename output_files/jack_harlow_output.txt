Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
This is incredible.
My name is Jack Harlow and it's been a big year for me.
I put out my second album. I went on a world tour. I just shot my first movie, White Men Can't Jump.
And a lot of people have been saying I'm the goat.
They don't mean greatest of all time, they mean that one from Narnia.
Yeah, I I I don't know what it is about me, but people, people on the Internet, they like to roast me and.
Our mind, I think it's funny, one guy said. I don't know why y'all think Jack Harlow is so special. You can find somebody who looks like him at any local gas station.
I've heard them say I look like if you tried to draw Justin Timberlake from memory.
I think I think my favorite one might be Jack Harlow. Looks like the guy who rips the tickets in half at the movie theater.
Shall I agree?
There's also a strange amount of rumors about me. You know, some people think I'm only 5 foot ten. Stop it.
Other people think I was created by the CIA. No telling.
Some people have even gone as far as to accuse me of being white.
I've seen a lot of kids running around dressed as me for Halloween too, and I just, I just want to say like, cut it out because my culture is not a costume.
I've also heard people try to romantically link me and little Nazix as an item.
But no, I'm going to tell you right now, no, everything that happened between us was casual.
And consensual.
And one of the best nights of my entire life.
Working with him. Working with him. Working with him.
You know what's what's really crazy though, is that this show is live. Like, really live. It's one of the last real live shows. Basically. It's just this in the office. So.
Like, I can really do anything right now. Like, technically no one can stop me. I don't even have to stay on the stage.
I think I'd like to leave this stage.
That's beautiful. Listen, I just want to give a shout out to my family. My mom and dad are here tonight. My grandparents are here tonight.
I'm I'm so grateful for you. Y'all are the reason I get to stand on this stage and say.
We have a great show for you tonight. I'm here. Stick around, we'll be right back.
ack.
