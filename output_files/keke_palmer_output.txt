Thank you very much. I'm so excited to be here in New York.
It's Christmas time, the tree is lit and most importantly, it's Sagittarius season.
And that's not for me, because I'm a Sagittarius Moon, honey. Yes, I'm very into astrology and I know all the Bros out there going to say astrology is not real. And to that I say, how's that crypto going?
This has been an awesome year for me. I was in Jordan. Pills. No.
I was nominated for an Academy Award.
That part is not true, but it's not lying if I'm university.
That's one of those things you just learn to do in this business manifest, honey.
Since I was nine years old, my first big role was in a movie I did called Keelan the Bee.
It was such a great experience. I had so much fun and except for when I got yelled at by Laurence Fishburne. No, for real, for real. We're doing a dramatic scene and I just started laughing at his ***. But God, I had a good reason. Just just imagine, OK, I'm a little kid watching a 40 year old man cry to me about winning a national spelling bee. It was hysterical. But when I started laughing he read me for Phil. He was like, you know, you can't do this. This is not what real actors do. And my Mama, she went off on him. Y'all OK, she is so Chicago. She started screaming, I don't care if you was in a matrix, I what? What did you say?
Those good times. And I honestly do appreciate that he did that. I mean, even though it was intense, I mean, he taught me how to be a professional in real time, you know? And I'm taking lessons from everyone I worked with. Aziz Ansari recently gave me some good advice on being SNL. He was like.
Piggy, just get up on stage. You know you're funny. You're funnier than me.
He didn't exactly say that, but that's what I heard.
Delusional queen.
I'm especially glad to be here, though, because there's some rumors going around. People have been in my comments saying Kiki's having a baby, Kiki's pregnant, and I want to set the record straight. I am.
It is bad when people on the Internet spread rumors about you y'all, but it's even worse when they're correct. I.
I was trying so hard to keep it on the down low because I got a lot of stuff going on. You know, people kept coming up to me. Congratulations. I'm like, can y'all stop. I got a liquor sponsorship on the line.
You have to check clear, then we can get to the damn baby shower. But honestly, this has been the biggest blessing and I am so excited. Guys, I'm going to be a mom.
Even though.
Some people feel a little weird about me having a baby because I was a child actor. I just want to say, look, I'm 29, I'm grown, OK? I have sex, I own a home. I stormed the capital on January 6th. You know, things the dogs do. I'm kidding. Y'all know I'm the same person I always been and I'm proud of that. Matter of fact.
When I first got into comedy and I dreamed of standing on this stage, I asked myself, Kiki, who will you be? You know, will you be like a Maya Rudolph? Eddie Murphy, a Kristen Wiig type? And now that I'm here, I can tell you exactly who I am. Baby. I'm Keke Palmer.
Baby. I'm Keke Palmer.
