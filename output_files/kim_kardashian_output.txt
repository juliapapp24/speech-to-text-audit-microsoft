And it's so great to be here tonight. I know I'm surprised to see me here too.
When they asked, I was like, you want me to host why I haven't had a movie premiere in a really long time.
I mean, actually, I only had that one movie come out and no one told me it was even premiering.
It must have slipped my mom's mind.
I'm excited to be here tonight to show you guys that I'm so much more than just a pretty face.
And good hair. And great makeup. And amazing *****. And a perfect ****. Basically, I'm just so much more than that reference photo my sister showed their plastic surgeons.
But the one thing I'm really proud of is that no one could ever call me a gold digger. Honestly, I'm not even sure how you become one. So I asked my momma's boyfriend, Corey.
I've been very lucky in life and I know that I'm privileged, which is why I try to give back as much as I can. A real passion of mine is getting wrongly accused. People out of jail. I think I'm following in my father's footsteps.
Now you know, my father was and still is such an influence and inspiration to me, and I credit him with really opening up my eyes to racial injustice. It's because of him that I met my first black person.
Want to take a stab in the dark at who it was?
I know, it's sort of weird to remember the first black person you met.
OJ does leave a mark or several or not at all? I still don't know.
But listen.
Listen, I'm an influencer, so I understand that the things that I say carry weight. But you know, I would never tell anyone what they can or can't do. Remember, I'm a Kim, not a Karen. And honestly?
With all of the K names, it's really impressive. Then my mom didn't pick Karen. I mean, somehow she just knew. I don't know how she saw that one coming and not Caitlin.
Now I know we're divided as a country, but I love America to come together, which is why I'm here to announce that I'm running for I'm just kidding.
I'm not running for president. We can't have three failed politicians in one family.
I've been very blessed in this life and I'm grateful for everything, honestly. All the UPS, all the downs. I mean, I married the best rapper of all time.
Not only that, he's the richest black man in America. A talented, legit genius who gave me 4 incredible kids.
So when I divorced him, you have to know it came down to just one thing, his personality.
I know that sounds mean, but people keep telling me that comedy comes from truth. And if there's one thing that I always strive to be, it's genuine. So I just want to say how incredibly excited I am to be up here on the stage tonight. I mean, I'm so used to having 360 million followers watching my every move, and I mean how many people watch SNL? Like 10 million. So tonight? Tonight is just a chill, intimate night for me. So we have a really great show for you tonight.
onight.
