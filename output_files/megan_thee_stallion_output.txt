Thank you, thank you, thank you very much. I can't tell y'all how excited I am to be here.
Most of y'all know me as Megan Stallion, but if you know me, then you know I go by more than one name. Let's see. We got Tina Snow.
The hot girl coach.
The H Town Hottie.
And if you are one of my many, many haters, I'm probably that *****.
But that's OK, because even my haters aren't entirely wrong. Because I am simply that *****.
Everyone is used to seeing me twer do who rest up my hood friends and flat out being one of the hottest emcees in the game right now. Period.
But there's so much more to me than meets the eye. For example, I'm a really good actress.
Like, I don't want to my own horn or nothing, but I think I do a pretty good British accent.
Alright, check this out.
Put me in Bridgeton, *****.
College degree last year from Texas Southern University.
Finishing college while pursuing a Rep career is not easy, and I did that while putting out song after song and going on the world tour.
So now I can go buy another name.
Making the ***** that needs some sleep.
I got my degree in Health Administration because I have always wanted to help the people in my community. I believe that is important to have a sharp mind and a sharp body, yadda yadda yadda yadda.
That's why I launched my website that provides access to resources for those who are struggling with their mental health. Bad ******* have bad days too.com.
That's a real website.
I can't believe the domain wasn't already taken.
It's supposed to be called Hot Girl. Bummer, but somebody stole it.
You know who you are.
But look, before the show starts, it's something I've really been wanting to say. I've had some wins and I've had some losses and I always get more wins, but I do pride myself on being an open book. So with that being said, I would like to address a certain incident that I'm sure is on everybody's mind.
No, I don't know why Papa took the honey sauce off the menu.
nu.
