Hello everyone, my name is Phoebe Waller Bridge and and I am honored to be here hosting SNL.
I'm from the UK, which means I find everything embarrassing, and this monologue is probably the most embarrassing thing I've ever done.
Standing in front of a jazz band in high heels on live television, joking about my accomplishments? Actually, that sounds pretty fun.
And anyway, when I asked do we have to do this bit, they said yes, it's part of your visa.
I wrote and acted in a TV show called Fleabag.
This is about a woman who is trying to navigate her life in London. People often assume that I am like the character Fleabag simply because I wrote it sexually depraved, foul mouths and dangerous. And I always have to say to them, yes.
You're absolutely right. In fact, everything I write has a degree of truth, and every project is different. I'm not a sex addict because I wrote Fleabag, but I did write Killing Eve because I'm a psychopath.
And my most exciting ex-boyfriend wrote nothing but was both.
It's a great time to be a psychopath right now.
They're really having a moment, don't you think?
When I was writing Killing Eve, I did a lot of research on psychopaths. So much so that I did actually start to believe that everyone in my life was one. I told my housemate I think you might be a psychopath, and he responded immediately with I have empathy.
So I found a little unnerving, but, you know, sexy.
Fleabag came from a very personal place for me. It began as a way to get Andrew Scott to dress up as a priest and tell me that he loves me.
It took me 6 years and two seasons to achieve it, but I did it.
Yeah, I don't care about awards. I just want gay men to love me.
And I called the character Priest in the script, but everyone started calling him hot priest. Obviously Andrew is hot, but this Priest character caused such a horn storm. Andrew and I were trying to figure out what it was about him that was driving women so mental. And we boiled it down and realized it was because he was doing this one thing.
Listening.
Really, really listening Try guys.
But we all find weird things sexy, and women can now speak about openly about their desires without being burned at the stake. Which is nice. Love that back in the day, ***** women were to be feared, and now they're given Emmys.
The sexual conversation for women is expanding. The weirder your fantasies, The more open you are about it, the cooler you are. Oh, you lock your husband in the attic? Rock on this.
Whereas straight men these days you are allowed one fantasy.
If you're looking up anything other than a woman in her 30s in the ********** ******** you are a pervert.
Burn him.
Now, for a while obsessed with sex, it's incredible how little attention we actually pay our genitals when we focus on them. Or if they, you know, they get sick or something. It's all about them. But the rest of the time they're just sitting there.
They're just sitting there.
Patiently.
Like.
I mean, think about how many of them are in this room right now.
Just think about all the genitals all across America sat on couches right now. Just like.
So to honor their patients at home and here, let's give them a good time. We have a great.
eat.
