Oh, this is an amazing night. I'm so happy to be here. You may know me from a movie called Girls Trip. It came out this past.
Queen Latifah, Jada Pinkett Smith, Regina Hall, and me Tiffany Haddish.
Now this movie, it made history. It made $100 million plus, OK? And I'm trying to figure out where is my cut of that money because I haven't seen it at all yet.
And all my friends are telling me Tiffany you will star now you big time you balling out of control and I'm looking at my bank account like.
They said Google yourself. So I googled myself. Tiffany had a celebrity net worth and it said I was worth $2,000,000. Y'all but I ain't seen this money. Where is this $2,000,000? What do I got to do to get this $2,000,000? Do I need to fake my death? Like do I got a Tupac this and move to Tyler Perry Island?
Y'all not Tyler Perry. Got an island, right?
But honestly though, before I was in Girls Trip, I grew up in foster care and I want to say thank you to anyone who paid taxes between 1990 and 1999, because if you would have paid your taxes, I would have been standing here today. So thank you.
Thank you.
I lived.
I lived in a lot of group homes, and my favorite show growing up was SNL. That's my favorite show. And you to have no idea how difficult it is to get a bunch of black and Hispanic kids to watch SNL over in living color. OK, try to convince him that Dana Carvey is just as funny as Damon Wayans was a problem. I got stabbed twice. Y'all in a Bugbee, OK? That's why I mess with bunk beds to this day. I don't mess with him. They scare me.
They told me I should talk about something that's going on in the world, politics, something hot topic. Well, here's the thing. I don't really pay attention to the news or anything. All my news comes from the beauty shop, OK? When I get my hair done, I find out what's going on in the world. And we've been talking about a lot of different stuff. They were talking about in the beauty shop just the other day about Donald Trump. And we were saying, Dang, who is doing Donald Trump's wigs? His lace fronts are off the chain. His hair is looking so good since he became the president, what kind of glue is he using 'cause when the wind blow, it don't even move or nothing.
That's good. Here, right here. And we've been talking about the whole sexual harassment stuff that's been going on. And look here. OK, guys, fellas, I got a tip for. Y'all. I like to call it Tiffany's tips. It's a tip tip. Listen, fellas, listen, OK? If you got your thing thing out and she got all her clothes on, you're wrong. You're in the wrong.
Wait till she take her own clothes off, then pull your thing thing out, OK?
Speaking of men getting in trouble and stuff this past few months, I shot a movie with Kevin Hart this summer, OK? And Kevin came up to me one day at work and said, Tiffany, you've been to Thailand, China, Japan. You went to Florida, you went to, you went to Texas, you was in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and you did all that in the same day. I was like, Nah, Kevin, it took me like 2 years to go to all those places. He was like really, 'cause I went on your Instagram and you was wearing the same outfit in all those places.
And here's the thing. That's why I can't stand about the Internet 'cause it's messing with my fashion game. I feel like I should be able to wear what I want when I want, however many times I want, as long as I for breezing. What?
Like this dress. I wore it on the red carpet for Girls Trip and my whole team. They told me, Tiffany, you cannot wear that dress on SNL. You already wore it. It's taboo to wear it twice. And I said I don't give a Dang about no taboo. I spent a lot of money on this dress. This dress cost way more than my mortgage. This Alexander McQueen, OK?
It's a $4000 dress. I'm gonna wear this dress multiple times.
You might see this dress in two sketches tonight, OK?
If somebody invites me to a bar about mitts, but guess what? I'm wearing to it this Alexander McQueen. If somebody invites me to an all black party, guess what I'm wearing this all white dress.
If another man asked me to marry him if I ever get married again, And yes, I've been married before. People are always shocked when I say that, like Tiffany, you've been married. Yes, I'm a beautiful woman, OK?
I'm gonna get married two or three more times. I might. Elizabeth Taylor. This thing you don't know.
But if another man asked me to marry him, guess what? I'm wearing this dress. And shoot, don't invite me to your wedding 'cause I'll probably wear this dress to it too.
And if I die, which I hope I never do, I hope I live forever. But if I die?
And even if I become fat as hell, OK, if I'm the biggest fattest, I don't care when I'm laying in that casket, guess what's going to be laying on top of my fat *** body? This dress.
Now.
Now if somebody invited me to a Baptist Church and they say they want me to participate in the praise and worship dance, I want wearing this dress to the church and I'm going to dance my **** off any and I.
