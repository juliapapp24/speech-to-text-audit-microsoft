THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH! MY NAME IS AYO EDEBIRI, AND I AM SO EXCITED TO BE HERE. SNL MEANS SO MUCH TO ME. THIS REALLY IS A DREAM COME
TRUE. I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN BOSTON, WHICH MAKES ME THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN TO EVER ADMIT THAT. YEAH. THREE DAYS INTO FEBRUARY, AND I'M ALREADY MAKING BLACK HISTORY. BUT NO I WAS RAISED IN BOSTON BY AN IMMIGRANT FAMILY. WE ARE BOTH AFRICAN AND CARIBBEAN, SO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, I'M IN THERAPY. THERE WERE A LOT OF HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR ALL OF US. A LOT OF MY COUSINS ARE DOCTORS AND LAWYERS AND PROFESSORS, SO WHILE THEY WERE BUSY SAVING LIVES AND TEACHING CHILDREN, I WAS DOING SOMETHING EQUALLY NOBLE, STANDUP ECONOMIC SHOWS IN THE BACK OF LAUNDROMATS. BUT NOW I'M PROUD TO SAY I'M THE COUSIN WHO MADE THE BIGGEST TURNAROUND, AND NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, I WILL ALWAYS HAVE THE APPROVAL OF ALL NIGERIAN AUNTS AND UNCLES ACROSS THE WORLD ON WHATSAPP. SOME OF YOU MIGHT KNOW ME FROM A SHOW CALLED THE BEAR. IT'S ABOUT THE KITCHEN STAFF AT
A CHICAGO RESTAURANT. AND IT'S SUCH A FUN SHOW TO WORK ON. BUT WHEN I GOT CAST, I WAS TOLD THERE WAS GOING TO BE A LOT OF RESEARCH. BEFORE SHOOTING THE FIRST SEASON, WE ALL HAD TO WORK IN ACTUAL RESTAURANTS SO WE COULD TRULY CAPTURE THAT KITCHEN ENERGY. WHEN PEOPLE SAW MY COSTAR JEREMY ALLEN WHITE WORKING IN THE RESTAURANT, THEY BE LIKE, WOAH THATâ€™S JEREMY ALLEN WHITE MUST BE PREPARING FOR A ROLE, SO METHOD.
WHEN THEY SAW ME, THEY JUST BE LIKE, HOW MUCH LONGER FOR MY TILAPIA.
BEFORE ALL OF THIS, I WAS A STANDUP COMIC IN NEW YORK CITY, WRITING JOKES AND DOING OPEN MICS. FIRST EVER ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR OPEN MICS.
BUT I REALLY ALWAYS WANTED TO DO THE SHOW, AND I JUST HAD SO MANY IDEAS.
I ACTUALLY ONCE WROTE A PACKET, BUT I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE THE NERVE TO SUBMIT IT AND I PRINTED IT OUT. IS IT OKAY IF I SHARE SOME STUFF? OH, MY GOD.
THIS IS TAKING ME BACK. YEAH. OH OKAY YEAH. THIS ONE, I SEE RIGHT HERE.
YOU GUYS KNOW THAT SKETCH BLACK JEOPARDY? YEAH
SO I WANTED TO DO A SKETCH CALLED WHITE JEOPARDY WHICH DIDN'T WORK BECAUSE IT WAS JUST WHITE PEOPLE PLAYING JEOPARDY. OH OKAY YEAH.
AND THEN OKAY YEAH AND THEN THIS ONE, JUST -- I LOVE A
CHARACTER WITH A CATCH PHRASE, YOU KNOW, LIKE CATCH PHRASESWORK BECAUSE ANYBODY CAN SAY THEM AND GET A BIG REACTION, AND
THIS ONE WAS HOP ON TO IT NUH. IT'S NOT BAD. IT'S NOT THE WORST.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? ANYONE CAN SAY IT, A CASTMEMBER, A HOST.
JUST IMAGINE KENAN  YOU KNOE BEING LIKE,
HOP ON TO IT NAH, YOU KNOW? OR THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND JUST
BEING LIKE, HOP ON TO IT NAH. TRADE MARKING THAT TONIGHT.
OKAY. YEAH, I THINK WE'RE DONE WITH THIS. BURN IT.
GENUINELY, I AM SO EXCITED FOR TONIGHT. I CAME UP IN THE NEW YORK COMEDY
SCENE WITH SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS WHO I AM SO BLESSED TO
BE WORKING WITH HERE TONIGHT, AND IT REALLY TRULY FEELS LIKE A HOMECOMING, AND I THINK I'VE BEEN UP HERE LONG ENOUGH, SO THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE THING TO SAY. LET'S HOP ON TO IT NUH.
WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT. JENNIFER LOPEZ IS
