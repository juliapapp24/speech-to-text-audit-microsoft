Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. I can’t believe it’s Saturday Night Live in New York city. My name is Daniel Kaluuya. First of all, I know you’re hearing my accent and thinking, “Oh no, he’s not black. He’s British.” And I assure you that I am black. I’m black and I’m British. Basically, I’m what the royal family was worried the baby would look like. People ask me what’s worse? British racism or American racism? Let me put it this way. British racism is so bad, white people left. They wanted to be free. Free to create their own kind of racisms. So then, that’s why they invented Australia, South Africa and Boston. My family is from Uganda.My family is from Uganda. Anyone from Uganda here? That’s my auntie. She is here. I come from a big Ugandan family. It’s no joke. My mum’s one of 22 kids and my dad’s one of 49. My family sperm is literally about that life. They say black don’t crack, but condoms do.
I just potrayed the leader of Illinois chapter of the Black Panther party. A man A man A man who created strategies for free education, free healthcare and free breakfast for kids. His name is Chairman Fred Hampton. And I actually won a Golden Globe for that role. But wait, wait,wait, oh it was on Zoom. And this is what happened.
I was muted. Can you believe that? I told the best joke of my life and I was muted. I felt like I was in a psycho place. Now, before we get started, I just want to say how grateful I am to be here. When I was nine years old, I wrote a play that got performed in Hampshire with real actors and everything. This is a true story. That play was based on Kenan and Kel. Yeah. And that play let me down a path that got me to this stage tonight Kenan backstage right now. So, I just want to take this moment in front of Kenan and whole world to say “Thank you mum, thank you god, and thank you Kel.” We’ve got a great show. St. Vincent is here. Stick around and we will be right back.
