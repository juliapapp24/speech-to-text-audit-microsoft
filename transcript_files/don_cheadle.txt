Thank you. Thank you very much. It is so great to be here. I entered ‘The Avengers Host SNL’ Raffle, and I won! So this is my first time hosting, and I think I waited this long, because I’m a little O.C.D. about my projects. I was in the movie ‘Traffic’. Then I was in ‘Rush Hour’. Then I was in ‘Crash’. So that had to be in the right order. I’ve been in show business for over 30 years and a lot of people know me. And a whole lot of people, sorta know me, you know. I get what I call ‘Percussive recognition’. People are like – “oh, you’re, um—um—’ , you know, the longer it goes on, it kind of turns into a Tito Puente thing like— like uh uh uh. But when you’ve played as many characters as I have, you’ve got fans from a lot of different things. It’s gotten to the point where I know what people recognize me from based on the face they make when they walk up. You know if I get a dude with a face like— I know it’s ‘Boogie Nights’. If I get this that’s ‘Hotel Rwanda’ face. And if I get this – well, that’s the face of a true fan who realizes he’s about to meet “ice tray” from the ‘Homeboy, Sweet Homeboy’ episode of ‘Fresh Prince of Bel-Air’. !
You know really, I love any fan who wants to meet me. Especially the people from New York city. I love New Yorkers, because they are direct. Most places, it’s “Hey, can I take a picture?” But in New York it’s like, “Yo, let’s get this pic dawg”. And you know we’re not gonna stop with just one pic. I mean. We’re gonna have three options. We gotta get the goofy one, and we gotta get the serious one, and then all of a sudden I’m taking a picture of just them. I’m not even in the thing. I’m always happy to take a picture. The key is, if you got to wait for the proper moment because—
I’m kind of in the middle of my monologue right now.
I got you. I got you. We’re good. We’re good
