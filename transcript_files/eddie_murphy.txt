Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. It’s great to be back here, finally hosting “Saturday Night Live” for Christmas. Yeah This is the last episode of 2019, if you’re black, it is the first episode since I left back in 1984. It's been a really long time. Here’s actually a picture of me back when I started. Yeah, I look at least five years younger there. You know what they always say, money don’t crack. so much has changed. I actually just had a new baby just about a year ago. That means I have 10 kids now. 11, if you count Kevin Hart. I’m Kidding, I love Kevin Hart. I’m just teasing. my kids are pretty much my whole life now. And you know what? But if you had told me 30 years ago that I would be this boring stay at home, you know, house dad and Bill Cosby would be in jail, even I would’ve took that bet. “Who is America’s dad now?” Yeah I also have a new movie right now that’s playing on Netflix called “Dolomite Is My Name.” And we just finished shooting a “Coming to America” sequel too. And if you’re wondering why I’ve been working so hard lately, it’s because 10 kids are very expensive.
